  # swayidle runs as a systemd user service. home-manager binds it to
  # graphical-session.target, but on NixOS the Sway session activates
  # sway-session.target, and only after importing WAYLAND_DISPLAY into the
  # systemd user manager. Because swayidle's unit has
  # ConditionEnvironment=WAYLAND_DISPLAY, binding it to graphical-session.target
  # makes the condition evaluate too early and the unit is skipped. Re-bind it to
  # sway-session.target so it starts once the environment exists.
  #
  # Schedule: hibernate at 10 min (battery only, see
  # hibernate-on-battery.service). The lock/panel-off timeouts are longer and
  # are reached only if hibernation is skipped (i.e. on AC).
